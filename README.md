# WeatherApplication
A weather application to give live insights over the current weather scenario of any region around the world. This application is made in such a way that it will retrieve the date and day's nfotmation via your system. There is a text area in the top of the application where you can enter the location you want to enter to get real time insights of the regional weather data. I have used the openweatherAPI to get yhe real time insights, and integrated my application using NODE.JS.
